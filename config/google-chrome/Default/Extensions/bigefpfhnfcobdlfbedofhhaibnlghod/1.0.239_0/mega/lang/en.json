It offers free and paid Internet-accessible storage space and bandwidth. It allows you to store and access your files from within your web browser or through dedicated client applications.","264":"To the best of our knowledge, cloud storage and encryption are legal. Please comply with applicable laws and regulations on [B]how[\/B] you use cloud storage and encryption as well as our [A]Terms of Service[\/A].","265":"MEGA was made by the same people that had previously run one of the world's largest cloud storage businesses. Can I please have my account and my files back?","266":"Unfortunately, MEGA has no access to any of the assets that its employees have created previously. There is no legal connection and no recycling of any code, hardware or database records, and we therefore currently see no way of recovering your legacy data.","267":"Why base a cloud storage company in New Zealand, of all places?","268":"Among other important reasons, New Zealand's native M\u0101ori name is \"Aotearoa\", which means \"Land of the long white cloud\".","269":"Can I access MEGA on my mobile device?","270":"You can access MEGA through your mobile browser, but this severely limits performance and functionality. We recommend using our dedicated mobile app for your device instead.","271":"Can I resume interrupted up- or downloads?","272":"Yes, as long as you do not close the browser tab, uploads and downloads will resume automatically after e.g. a network interruption or your device having entered standby\/sleep mode. Please note that our servers automatically discard incomplete uploads after 48 hours of inactivity.","273":"Can I upload the same file multiple times?","274":"Because the server can't see filenames, filename collisions have to be dealt with on the client side. With standard settings, if you upload a file that you already seem to have in your account (same target path\/filename, same size, same last modification time), it is skipped, but nothing prevents you from keeping multiple files or folders with the same name in the same folder.","275":"How do you regulate bandwidth utilization?","276":"Our policy is not to impose any artificial restrictions on our users unless necessitated by infrastructure bottlenecks.  We therefore reserve the right to cap user bandwidth utilization for operational reasons at any time on a per-IP basis. Your transfer queue will resume automatically once the congestion eases. No manual intervention is required.","277":"Are there any file size limits on MEGA?","278":"We do not impose artificial file size limits other than your available cloud drive space. While all current browsers are capable of uploading large files, downloading is size-constrained with Internet Explorer and Safari due to their incomplete HTML5 support.","279":"Can I upload and download at the same time?","280":"Yes. One upload and one download per browser tab can run in parallel.","281":"Why don't you provide image thumbnails or streamed previewing of video and audio files?","282":"Because our end-to-end encryption model inherently precludes any server-side manipulation of your data, which would be required to implement such a feature.","283":"How do I upload files to MEGA?","284":"There are three ways of uploading files to MEGA using your web browser:","285":"1. Click on the red button on the start page","286":"2.\tGo to your file manager and click on the \"File Upload\" or (if you're using Chrome) \"Folder \tUpload\" buttons near the top","287":"3. Drag and drop files or (if you're using Chrome) folders onto the site","288":"How do I install MEGA?","289":"MEGA can be used with any modern web browser. However, depending on your specific browser's capabilities, some features may be unavailable - we strongly recommend using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera Next. Advanced functionality such as automated folder synchronization or filesystem mounts will be made available through installable client applications.","290":"How does folder sharing work?","291":"You can share any subtree of your cloud drive with friends, family or coworkers. Invitation is by e-mail address. Invitees who do not have an account yet will receive an e-mail notification with a signup link. Alternatively, you can create a public link to any of your folders and export the folder-specific crypto key, making it accessible without a MEGA account. It is then your responsibility to securely transmit the folder key to the recipient(s).","292":"To establish, modify or delete a share, simply right click on a folder in your file manager and select Sharing. There are three access levels: Read-only, read\/write (files can be added, but not deleted), and full (files can be added and deleted).","293":"If you added an e-mail address that did not have an account yet, you need to be online at least once after the recipient completes the signup process so that you can encrypt the share secret to his newly created public key.","294":"How do I delete people from my shared folder?","295":"Simply right click on a folder in your file manager and select sharing. You will see all people that currently have access to the shared folder. Right click on the person and choose the Delete option from the menu.","296":"How do I recognize my shared folders?","297":"Shared folders in your file manager have a special icon with a hand below the folder.","298":"Can I share folders that were shared with me?","299":"No. Folder shares are non-transitive.","302":"How do I link to a file on MEGA?","303":"First of all, a word of caution: The cryptographic security of your files depends on the confidentiality of the associated encryption keys. Make sure that you transmit them via protected channels only! Standard e-mail, for example, is not good enough.","304":"With that in mind, select one or multiple files in your file manager, then right-click and use \"Get link\". A dialog with the public link(s) to the file(s) you have selected will open. You can choose to export each link and key separately or as a single combo link.","305":"How does the encryption work?","306":"All encryption is end-to-end. Data uploaded is encrypted on the uploading device before it is sent out to the Internet, and data downloaded is decrypted only after it has arrived on the downloading device.  The client machines are responsible for generating, exchanging and managing the encryption keys. No usable encryption keys ever leave the client computers (with the exception of RSA public keys).","307":"Is all of my personal information subject to encryption?","308":"No. Only file data and file\/folder names are encrypted. Information that we need operational access to, such as your e-mail address, IP address, folder structure, file ownership and payment credentials, are stored and processed unencrypted. Please see our privacy policy for details.","309":"Is my stored data absolutely secure?","310":"All security is relative. The following attack vectors exist - they are not specific to MEGA, but we want you to know about the risks: ","311":"Individual accounts are jeopardized by:","312":"- Spyware on your computer. A simple keylogger is enough, but session credentials and keys could also be extracted from memory or the filesystem.","313":"- Shoulder surfing. Do not type your password while someone could watch your keystrokes.","314":"- Password brute-forcing. Use strong passwords.","315":"- Phishing. Always confirm the security status of your connection (https:\/\/) and the correct domain name (mega.co.nz) before entering your password.","316":"Large-scale attacks could be mounted through:","317":"- A \"man in the middle\" attack. Requires issuing a valid duplicate SSL certificate in combination with DNS forging and\/or attacks on our BGP routes (a DigiNotar-style scenario).","318":"- Gaining access to the webservers hosting https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/index.html and replacing that file with a forged version (this would not affect access through the installed app base). Note that manipulating content on our distributed static content CDN does not pose a security risk, as all active content loaded from index.html is subject to verification with a cryptographic hash (think of it as some kind of \"secure boot\" for websites). This type of attack requires sending malicious code to the client and is therefore detectable.","319":"- Gaining access to our core server infrastructure and creating forged key requests on existing shares. This type of attack only affects data in accounts with shared folders and is detectable on the client side as well.","320":"What if I don't trust you? Is it still safe for me to use MEGA?","321":"If you don't trust us, you cannot run any code provided by us, which precludes opening MEGA in your browser and entering your login credentials. However, due to MEGA's end-to-end encryption paradigm, you can safely use client applications written by someone you trust.","322":"I trust you and your New Zealand data centre, but I don't trust your German data centre, because it is run by a US company.  Is it still safe for me to use MEGA?","323":"Yes, you can still use MEGA (with a few limitations) safely with our core datacentre in Germany being fully compromised. The New Zealand data centre makes sure that no rogue code can run when you visit https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/.","324":"Is data that I put in shared folders as secure my other data?","325":"Shared folders, by nature, are only as secure as their least secure member. However, a compromise of our core server infrastructure poses an additional risk: Public keys could be manipulated, and key requests could be forged.","326":"Let's assume that a MEGA storage node is physically compromised. What are the risks?","327":"Error messages after downloading manipulated files. Even if the attacker had the encryption key for a given file on that node, he could still not replace it with a forged one without causing the subsequent downloads to fail.","328":"Is it a good idea to store all of my data in a single place?","329":"Always keep redundant copies of important files, online and offline. Although we keep each file in at least two locations, there is no guarantee against multiple concurrent failures and repeated unprecedented government misconduct.","330":"Why should I entrust my data to, of all people, you?","331":"We provide for user controlled encryption (UCE) where you, the user, control the keys. The UCE implementation is open source, and we invite and encourage the community to scrutinize it and provide feedback. We believe that this approach is much safer than storing your data on a provider with server-side encryption where the ISP controls the keys or, worse, no encryption at all. For example, if MEGA user files were suddenly accessible without a password due to a programming error, they would be unreadable without the user-controlled decryption keys.","332":"I noticed that you are using HTTPS for transferring already encrypted file data. Isn't that redundant?","333":"It is. Unfortunately, most browsers take offence with establishing insecure connections from a secure page, and who could blame them for that - they can't possibly be aware of the fact that there is another encryption layer already in operation. Because HTTPS has an adverse effect on performance, we allow you to turn it off on browsers that allow it (Chrome, Safari and Firefox until version 17) to speed up your transfers without jeopardizing the confidentiality or integrity of your data. You will see an SSL warning appear upon your first file transfer in some browsers - in this (and only in this) case, it is safe to ignore.","334":"What encryption algorithms does MEGA use internally?","335":"For bulk transfers, AES-128 (we believe that the higher CPU utilization of AES-192 and AES-256 outweighs the theoretical security benefit, at least until the advent of quantum computers). Post-download integrity checking is done through a chunked variation of CCM, which is less efficient than OCB, but not encumbered by patents.","336":"For establishing shared secrets between users and dropping files into your inbox, RSA-2048 (the key length was chosen as middle grounds between \"too insecure\" and \"too slow\"). All encryption, decryption and key generation is implemented in JavaScript, which limits throughput to a few MB\/s and causes significant CPU load. We are looking forward to the implementation of the proposed HTML5 WebCrypto API in all major browsers, which will eliminate this bottleneck.","337":"JavaScript's built-in random number generator is enhanced through a mouse\/keyboard timing-driven RC4 entropy pool as well as crypto.* randomness where available (Chrome and Firefox only at the moment - keys generated by Internet Explorer and Safari are less secure than they could be).","338":"Does MEGA keep backups of my files?","339":"We store your files on at least two servers in different datacentres, if available.","340":"I have forgotten my password. Can I reset it?","344":"When do I need to upgrade to a Pro account?","345":"A Pro account gives you additional storage space and extra bandwidth quota that we automatically draw from whenever an operational bandwidth limit is reached - you can use the quota yourself, or grant it to third parties accessing your data (this includes users without a MEGA account).  The maximum percentage of your bandwidth quota allocated to third parties is configurable in your account settings.","346":"What is the upload speed limiting feature good for?","347":"Many routers do not prioritize smaller packets in case of link congestion, resulting in your inbound traffic being severely affected when your outbound link is full. We therefore offer an automatic speed management option where we measure your available outbound bandwidth during the initial ten seconds of an upload and then keep at least 10% of it unused. You can also set a fixed throughput limit.","348":"What do I get with my free account?","349":"A globally accessible, high-performance, secure cloud drive with [X] of storage space. If you need more than that, you can upgrade to a [A1]Pro[\/A1] account. Click [A2]here[\/A2] to see your current utilization.","359":"Do you offer an API?","361":"Yes. Please use our software development kit to add MEGA support to your application.","362":"To prevent resource overload, we sometimes have to cap bandwidth utilization. The file you are trying to download is larger than our current limit of [X3]. Its transfer has been postponed and will start automatically once the congestion eases.","365":"Your browser is not modern enough to download a file this large.","366":"Copyright warning","367":"MEGA respects the copyrights of others and requires that users of the MEGA cloud service comply with the laws of copyright. You are strictly prohibited from using the MEGA cloud service to infringe copyrights. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.","368":"Caution:","369":"MEGA's cryptographic security model depends on the confidentiality of the keys displayed above.

If you enable downloading, the files will be duplicated on your computer.","1817":"More","1818":"MEGAsync is waiting","1819":"MEGAsync has been updated","1820":"Coming soon for Mac and Linux","1821":"When we launched MEGA early 2013, global mass surveillance by rogue governments under the pretext of fighting terrorism was still a wild conjecture and its proponents were often touted as conspiracy theorists. Edward Snowden's revelations 137 days later fundamentally changed public attitudes and it became excruciatingly clear that <i>security by policy<\/i> (\"we have access to your data, but we promise to keep it confidential and not misuse it\") had not been good enough. Anything short of <i>security by design<\/i> (\"we cannot gain access to your data without you being able to find out\"), for which strong end-to-end encryption is an essential prerequisite, now seems grossly insufficient.","1822":"MEGA was architected around the simple fact that cryptography, for it to be accepted and used, must not interfere with usability. MEGA is fully accessible without prior software installs and remains the only cloud storage provider with browser-based high-performance end-to-end encryption. The only visible signs of the crypto layer operating under MEGA's hood are the entropy collection during signup, the lack of a password reset feature and the novel (and browser-specific) ways file transfers are conducted. Today, millions of business and personal users rely on MEGA to securely and reliably store and serve petabytes of data and we believe that this success is the result of MEGA's low barrier to entry to a more secure cloud.","1823":"We are constantly hiring. If you are an outstanding software engineer and would like to join our global team, please do not hesitate to submit your CV to jobs@mega.co.nz.","1824":"You are currently logged in. Would you like to log out and register a new account?","1825":"What is MEGAsync?","1826":"MEGAsync is an installable application that synchronizes folders between your computer and your MEGA cloud drive. All files and subfolders will be replicated both ways. Changes that you make on one side will appear on the other side in near real time (within the limits of link\/system latency and file transfer times).","1827":"How do I install MEGAsync?","1828":"Go to the [A]download page[\/A] and follow the instructions. During the installation, you will be asked to enter or create your MEGA account and to set up the folders to replicate (either your full MEGA cloud drive and folder structure to a single local folder location or specific subfolders in your cloud drive to corresponding local folders). After the installation completes, MEGAsync will start automatically. Under Windows, you will see a clickable MEGA logo in the system tray while the sync tool is running that gives you access to a status popup and the settings page.","1829":"Can I use MEGAsync on multiple computers?","1830":" Yes. By synchronizing multiple devices with the same cloud folder, you can achieve cross-computer syncing (provided you use the same MEGA account on each device).","1831":"How can I monitor the sync status of my local files and folders?","1832":"Icons of files and folders that are in sync with the cloud will be tagged with a green circle. Transfers in progress are indicated by a blue circle; pending transfers show in red.","1833":"MEGAsync stores my login credentials to perform autologin. Isn't that a security concern?","1834":"Not if you keep your local drive encrypted (please do - why would you want to sync from an encrypted cloud drive to an unencrypted local drive?).","1835":"I deleted a file from a local synced folder while MEGAsync was not running. Then I started it, and the file reappeared. Why?","1836":"The current version of MEGAsync does not remember your local filesystem state across restarts. It has no way of knowing that a local file has gone missing since the last time it was run. Therefore, always keep MEGAsync running if you want your local deletions to be replicated properly.","1837":"An important file was overwritten or deleted by the sync client. What can I do to get it back?","1838":"On the cloud side, deleted files will be moved to a special \"SyncDebris\" subfolder structure in your Rubbish Bin and can be retrieved from there (use MEGA's built-in search if needed). On the local computer, each sync's root folder will have a hidden \"Debris\" folder in which deleted items are placed.","1839":"Does MEGAsync perform explicit file versioning?","1840":"No. However, you can access overwritten files in the respective debris folders until they are purged.","1841":"Does MEGAsync support modifying existing files?","1842":"No. If a synced file changes, it is always replaced as a whole. Therefore, it is not recommended to sync e.g. large log files or database tables. Encrypted delta writes are planned for a future release.","1845":"Are there any restrictions with regards to filenames?","1846":"MacOS\/UNIX filenames are case sensitive, Windows filenames are not. A folder containing both \"ABC.TXT\" and \"abc.txt\" can be synced to a UNIX machine without problems, but when synced to a Windows machine, only one of the two files will survive.","1847":"MEGA imposes no restrictions on filenames - they can contain characters that are incompatible with the operating system, such as : or *. These will be rewritten as %xx on the local side and converted back to the original character when synced back. The Windows Explorer also has trouble with a number of seemingly innocuous file and folder names - \"con.doc\", for example, would not be accessible (to understand why, you have to be a geek or a veteran, or both). If you encounter such a situation, simply rename the file on the cloud side. Foreign characters in filenames are fully supported.","1848":"MEGAsync supports fairly deep folder structures (MEGA itself is limited to a maximum of 63 levels) and very long pathnames (up to 32,000 characters under Windows). Unfortunately, most Windows software (including the Explorer) is unable to access files whose path is longer than 260 characters.","1849":"How can I make sure that I always have the latest version of MEGAsync?","1850":"MEGAsync checks for a new version every two hours and updates itself once one is available (you can turn this off in the settings - the next check is then performed when you turn it back on). For security reasons, only the account that initially installed MEGAsync is allowed to update it.","1851":"Will MEGAsync use peer-to-peer transfers to achieve faster syncing between computers in the same local area network?","1852":"No. The current incarnation of MEGAsync always syncs via MEGA's cloud infrastructure.","1853":"What happens if conflicting concurrent actions are performed on clients synced to the same cloud location?","1854":"The current version of MEGAsync does not resolve such clashes in a deterministic manner. Avoid them if possible.","1855":"Does MEGAsync support advanced filesystem features such as links, attributes, ACLs, streams\/forks or sparse files?","1856":"No. Do not expect these to be replicated to the cloud.","1857":"Does MEGAsync support syncing the same local folder to different remote locations or the same remote folder to different local locations?","1858":"No, unless you want to run multiple MEGAsync processes in parallel, which is not recommended. As a general rule, each filesystem item must only be visible to MEGAsync once, so avoid syncing subfolders of synced folders or placing multiple links to the same filesystem item in a local synced folder.","1859":"Where can I find your iOS app?","1860":"You can download and install our iOS app on the [A]App Store[\/A].","1861":"Where can I find your Android app?","1862":"You can download and install our Android app on [A]Google Play[\/A].","1863":"We are providing dedicated [A]apps[\/A] for your mobile device, including for [B]iOS[\/B] & [C]Android[\/C].","1864":"Error report","1865":"MEGAsync has detected a problem.

A folder containing both \"ABC.TXT\" and \"abc.txt\" can be synced to a UNIX machine without problems, but when synced to a Windows machine, only one of the two files will survive.MEGA imposes no restrictions on filenames - they can contain characters that are incompatible with the operating system, such as : or *. These will be rewritten as %xx on the local side and converted back to the original character when synced back. The Windows Explorer also has trouble with a number of seemingly innocuous file and folder names - \"con.doc\", for example, would not be accessible (to understand why, you have to be a geek or a veteran, or both). If you encounter such a situation, simply rename the file on the cloud side. Foreign characters in filenames are fully supported.MEGAsync supports fairly deep folder structures (MEGA itself is limited to a maximum of 63 levels) and very long pathnames (up to 32,000 characters under Windows).

All data transfers from and to MEGA are encrypted. And while most cloud storage providers can and do claim the same, MEGA is different \u2013 unlike the industry norm where the cloud storage provider holds the decryption key, with MEGA, you control the encryption, you hold the keys, and you decide who you grant or deny access to your files, without requiring any risky software installs.

The only way to decrypt\/ make it readable is to download it back, while logged in to your file manager.

The only way to get the file is to be correctly logged into that account. This is UCE.

The following attack vectors exist - they are not specific to MEGA, but we want you to know about the risks: ","6460":"Individual accounts are jeopardized by:","6461":"- Spyware on your computer. A simple keylogger is enough, but session credentials and keys could also be extracted from memory or the filesystem.","6462":"- Shoulder surfing. Do not type your password while someone could watch your keystrokes.","6463":"- Password brute-forcing. Use strong passwords.","6464":"- Phishing. Always confirm the security status of your connection (https:\/\/) and the correct domain name (mega.co.nz) before entering your password.","6465":"Large-scale attacks could be mounted through:","6466":"- A \"man in the middle\" attack. Requires issuing a valid duplicate SSL certificate in combination with DNS forging and\/or attacks on our BGP routes (a DigiNotar-style scenario).","6467":"- Gaining access to the webservers hosting https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/index.html and replacing that file with a forged version (this would not affect access through the installed app base). Note that manipulating content on our distributed static content CDN does not pose a security risk, as all active content loaded from index.html is subject to verification with a cryptographic hash (think of it as some kind of \"secure boot\" for websites). This type of attack requires sending malicious code to the client and is therefore detectable.","6468":"For bulk transfers, AES-128 (we believe that the higher CPU utilization of AES-192 and AES-256 outweighs the theoretical security benefit, at least until the advent of quantum computers). Post-download integrity checking is done through a chunked variation of CCM, which is less efficient than OCB, but not encumbered by patents.","6469":"For establishing shared secrets between users and dropping files into your inbox, RSA-2048 (the key length was chosen as middle grounds between \"too insecure\" and \"too slow\"). All encryption, decryption and key generation is implemented in JavaScript, which limits throughput to a few MB\/s and causes significant CPU load. We are looking forward to the implementation of the proposed HTML5 WebCrypto API in all major browsers, which will eliminate this bottleneck.","6470":"There is no need to worry. Anything we do send through RC4 is already encrypted from the point it leaves your browser so there is no security risk. For increased security make sure you have our browser extensions installed. MEGA's users get to enjoy the privacy of their data with our User Controlled Encryption (UCE) mechanism - the only storage provider on the market offering this level of security and privacy. ","6471":"We are now conducting a single node tests to see in how much the server load will increase when using AES instead of RC4 so we can provide an alternative to those who have turned off RC4.","6472":"For our customer's sake, some things are really important to us. One of these things is obviously security, whereas another one is performance. However, the former cannot be trumped by the latter!!!","6473":"When you log in, receive the `secureboot.js` file, or when you're connecting to our API, you will *always* be running through a properly configured web server, which will give you strong authentication, strong encryption, as well as forward secrecy (PFS). These are the places where it matters that information is transferred in a secure fashion when using SSL\/TLS!","6474":"Afterwards, when you're accessing further static content, or when you're accessing your file storage, the client side (that is for example the JavaScript code in your browser, a browser extension, a","6475":"sync client or a mobile app) will take care of ensuring security. Every content further loaded off of servers (e. g. the *.static.mega.co.nz servers) will be verified cryptographically by the client, and the content that could be seen on the wire is harmless. Every time data is transferred to or from our storage servers, the client side code will take care of proper, strong encryption, so that only ever the client alone is able to get access to the actual plain data.","6476":"Given these circumstances, we could actually serve all static content and\/or data transfers with our storage servers over a completely unencrypted connection. There would be *no* lack in security!","6477":"However, browsers will refuse to allow for unencrypted HTTP connections (for good reasons) when originating from an HTTPS encrypted site, or they will at least display a degradation in security in the browser bar. This is all very good and common practice, especially if SSL\/TLS is your line of defence when transmitting plain text data. For those reasons also, all subsequent connections generally should be of similar good strength in protection. However, as stated above, we don't actually need an encrypted HTTPS connection to uphold our protection (as we've taken care to completely encrypt the actual content already). But, we can't remove SSL\/TLS (HTTPS) completely, as that would make the look in the browser \"unhappy\". Therefore, we have opted to use the weakest","6478":"possible protection (RC4 with MD5) as a \"NULL cipher\" to prevent the browser from alarming people, whereas we would even be happy with an unencrypted connection altogether. This will give the end user an enhanced performance, *without* decreasing any security. And this is actually what our other clients are doing, they're getting rid of even RC4\/MD5, but use strong SSL\/TLS where needed.","6479":"I hope this rather lengthy description has cleared up the situation, and lets you enjoy MEGA without a stale feeling of insecurity or security by hand waving. We really do take it seriously, and have put *lots* of thoughts into it.","6480":"For more information read: https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/#blog_32","6481":"To ensure maximum security and privacy of your data we recommend you encrypt your local drive.","6482":"We recommend using either built-in \"Bitlocker\" (Windows) or TrueCrypt.","6483":"Definitely!
